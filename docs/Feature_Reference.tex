\hypertarget{intro}{}\section{Introduction}
The OpenType features of Junicode version 2 and its variable counterpart (hereafter referred to together as
``Junicode'') have two purposes. One is to provide convenient access to the rich character set of the Medieval Unicode
Font Initiative (MUFI) recommendation. The other is to enable best practices in the presentation of medieval text,
promoting accessibility in electronic texts from PDFs to e-books to web pages.
\thispagestyle{plain}

Each character in the MUFI recommendation has a code point\footnote{A Unicode code point is generally expressed as a
four-digit hexadecimal (or base-16) number with a prefix of ``U+''. The letter capital ``A,'' for example, is U+0041 (65
in decimal notation), and lowercase ``ȝ'' (Middle English yogh) is U+021D.} associated with it: either the one
assigned by Unicode or, where the character is not recognized by Unicode, in the Private Use Area (PUA) of the Basic
Multilingual Plane, a block of codes, running from U+E000 to U+F8FF, that are assigned no value by Unicode but instead
are available for font designers to use in any way they please.

The problem with PUA code points is precisely their lack of any value. Consider, as a point of comparison, the letter
\textLetterExample{a} (U+0061). Your computer, your phone, and probably a good many other devices around the house
store a good bit of information about this \textLetterExample{a}: that it’s a letter in the Latin script, that
it’s lowercase, and that the uppercase equivalent is \textLetterExample{A} (U+0041). All this information is
available to word processors, browsers, and other applications running on your computer.

Now suppose you're preparing an electronic text containing what MUFI calls \textUName{latin small letter neckless
a} (\textLetterExample{}). It is assigned to code point U+F215, which belongs to the PUA. Beyond that, your
computer knows nothing about it: not that it is a variant of \textLetterExample{a}, or that it is lowercase, or a letter in the Latin
alphabet, or even a character in a language system. A screen reader cannot read, or even spell out, a word with U+F215
in it; a search engine will not recognize the word as containing the letter \textLetterExample{a}.

Junicode offers the full range of MUFI characters---you can enter the PUA code points---but also a solution to the
problems posed by those code points. Think of an electronic text (a web page, perhaps, or a PDF) as having two layers:
an underlying text, stable and unchanging, and the displayed text, generated by software at the instant it is needed
and discarded when it is no longer on the screen. For greatest accessibility the underlying text should contain the
plain letter \textLetterExample{a} (U+0061) along with markup indicating how it should be displayed. To generate
the displayed text, a program called a ``layout engine'' will (simplifying a bit here) read the markup and apply the
OpenType feature \textSourceText{cv02[5]}\footnote{Many OpenType features produce different outcomes depending on
an index passed to an application’s layout engine along with the feature tag. Different applications have different
ways of entering this index: consult your application’s documentation. Here, the index is recorded in brackets after
the feature tag. Users of fontspec (with {\XeLaTeX} or {\LuaTeX}) should also be aware that fontspec indexes start at zero
while OpenType indexes start at one. Therefore all index numbers listed in this document must be reduced by one for
use with fontspec.\par } to the underlying \textLetterExample{a}, bypassing the PUA code point, with the result that
readers see \textLetterExample{\cvd[4]{2}{a}}{}---the ``neckless a.'' And yet the letter will still register as
\textLetterExample{a} with search engines, screen readers, and so on.

This is the Junicode model for text display, but it is not peculiar to Junicode: it is widely considered to be the best
practice for displaying text using current font technology.

The full range of OpenType features listed in this document is supported by all major web browsers, LibreOffice, XeTeX,
LuaTeX, and (presumably) other document processing applications. All characters listed here are available in Adobe
InDesign, though that program supports only a selection of OpenType features. Microsoft Word, unfortunately, supports
only Stylistic Sets, ligatures (all but the standard ones in peculiar and probably useless combinations), number
variants, and the \hyperlink{req}{Required Features}. In terms of
OpenType support, Word is the most primitive of the major text processing applications.

Many MUFI characters cannot be produced by using the OpenType variants of Junicode. These characters fall into three
categories:

\liststyleLi
\begin{itemize}
\item Those with Unicode (non-PUA) code points. MUFI has done valuable work obtaining Unicode code points for medieval characters.
All such characters (those with hexadecimal codes that \textstyleEmphasis{do not} begin with \textLetterExample{E}
or \textLetterExample{F}) are presumed safe to use in accessible and searchable text. However, some of these are
covered by Junicode OpenType features for particular reasons.
\item Precomposed characters---those consisting of base character + one or more diacritics. For greatest accessibility,
these should be entered not as PUA code points, but rather as sequences consisting of base character + one or more
diacritics. For example, instead of MUFI U+E498 \textUName{latin small letter e with dot below and acute}, use
\textLetterExample{e} + U+0323 \textUName{combining dot below} + U+0301 \textUName{combining acute accent}:
\textLetterExample{ẹ́} (when applying combining marks, start with any marks below the character and work
downwards, then continue with any marks above the character and work upwards. For example, to make
\textLetterExample{ǭ̣́}, place characters in this order: \textLetterExample{o},
\textUName{combining ogonek} U+0328, \textUName{combining dot below} U+0323, \textUName{combining
macron} U+0304, \textUName{combining acute} U+0301). Some MUFI characters have marks in unconventional locations,
e.g. \textLetterExample{ȯ́} \textUName{latin small letter o with dot above and acute}, where the
acute appears beside the dot instead of above. This and other characters like it should still be entered as a sequence
of base character + marks (here \textLetterExample{o}, \textUName{combining dot above} U+0307,
\textUName{combining acute} U+0301). Junicode will position the marks correctly.
\item Characters for which a base character (a Unicode character to which it can be linked) cannot be identified, or for
which there may be an inconsistency in the MUFI recommendation. These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textLetterExample{} U+E8AF. This is a ligature of long \textLetterExample{s} and \textLetterExample{l} with stroke,
but there are no base characters with this style of stroke.
\item \textLetterExample{} U+EFD8 and U+EFD9. MUFI lists these as ligatures (corresponding to the
historic ligatures \textLetterExample{\hlig{uuUU}}, but they cannot be treated as ligatures in the
font because a single diacritic is positioned over the glyphs as if they were digraphs like
\textLetterExample{ꜳꜲ}.
\item \textLetterExample{} U+EBE7 and U+EBE6, for the same reason.
\item \textLetterExample{} U+F159 \textUName{latin abbreviation sign small de}. Neither a variant of
\textLetterExample{d} nor an eth (\textLetterExample{ð}), this character may be a candidate for Unicode
encoding.
\end{itemize}
\item Characters for which OpenType programming is not yet available. These will be added as they are located and
studied. [Check: U+EBF1, and smcp version.]
\end{itemize}
These characters should be avoided, even if you are otherwise using MUFI’s PUA characters:

\liststyleLii
\begin{itemize}
\item U+F1C5 \textUName{combining curl high position}. Use U+1DCE \textUName{combining ogonek above}. The
positioning problem mentioned in the MUFI recommendation is solved in Junicode (and, to be fair, many other fonts with
OpenType programming).
\item U+F1CA \textUName{combining dot above high position}. Use U+0307 \textUName{combining dot above}. It
will be positioned correctly on any character.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{SectionA}{}\section{A. Case-Related Features}
\subsection[1. smcp {}-- Small Capitals]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}.
\textSourceText{smcp} -- Small Capitals}
Converts lowercase letters to small caps; also several symbols and combining marks. All lower- and uppercase pairs (with
exceptions noted below) have a small cap equivalent. Lowercase letters without matching caps may lack matching small
caps. fghij $\rightarrow $ \textsc{fghij}.

Note: Precomposed characters defined by MUFI in the Private Use Area have no small cap equivalents. Instead, compose
characters using combining diacritics, as outlined in the introduction. For example, \textSourceText{smcp} applied
to the sequence \textLetterExample{t} + \textUName{combining ogonek} (U+0328) + \textUName{combining
acute} (U+0301) will change \textLetterExample{t̨́} to \textLetterExample{\textsc{t̨́}}.

\subsection[2. c2sc {}-- Small Capitals from Capitals]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{c2sc} --
Small Capitals from Capitals}
Use with \textSourceText{smcp} for all-small-cap text. ABCDE $\rightarrow $ {\addfontfeature{Letters = UppercaseSmallCaps}ABCDE}.

\subsection[3. pcap {}-- Petite Capitals]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{pcap} -- Petite
Capitals}
Produces small caps in a smaller size than \textSourceText{smcp}. Use these when small caps have to be mixed with
lowercase letters. The whole of the basic Latin alphabet is covered, plus several other letters. klmno{\th}
$\rightarrow $ {\addfontfeature{Letters = PetiteCaps}klmno\th}.

\subsection[4. case {}-- Case{}-Sensitive Forms]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{case} --
Case-Sensitive Forms}
Produces combining marks that harmonize with capital letters: {\addfontfeature{Letters=Uppercase}\v{R}, X̉}, etc. Use of this feature reduces the
likelihood that a combining mark will collide with a glyph in the line above.

\hypertarget{SectionB}{}\section{B. Numbers and Sequencing}
\subsection[5. nalt {}-- Alternate Annotation Forms]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}.
\textSourceText{nalt} -- Alternate Annotation Forms}
Produces letters and numbers circled, in parenthesis, or followed by periods, as follows:

\textSourceText{nalt[1]}, circled letters or numbers: {\addfontfeature{Annotation=0}a b .~.~. z; 0 1 2 .~.~. 20}.

\textSourceText{nalt[2]}, letter or numbers in parentheses: {\addfontfeature{Annotation=1}a .~.~. z; 0 1 .~.~. 20}.

\textSourceText{nalt[3]}, double-circled numbers: {\addfontfeature{Annotation=2}0 1 .~.~. 10}.

\textSourceText{nalt[4]}, white numbers in black circles: {\addfontfeature{Annotation=3}0 1 2 3 . . . 20}.

\textSourceText{nalt[5]}, numbers followed by period: {\addfontfeature{Annotation=0}0 1 . . . 20}.

\noindent For enclosed figures 10 and higher, \textSourceText{rlig} (Required Ligatures) must also be enabled (as it should
be by default: see \hyperlink{req}{Required Features} below).

\subsection[6. tnum {}-- Tabular Figures]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{tnum} -- Tabular
Figures}
Fixed-width figures: 0123456789 (default or with \textSourceText{lnum}), {\addfontfeature{Numbers=OldStyle}0123456789} (with
\textSourceText{onum}).

\subsection[7. onum {}-- Oldstyle Figures]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{onum} -- Oldstyle
Figures}
Figures that harmonize with lowercase characters: {\addfontfeature{Numbers=OldStyle}0123456789} (default or with
\textSourceText{tnum}), {\addfontfeature{Numbers={Proportional,OldStyle}}0123456789}
(with \textSourceText{pnum}). When combined with \textSourceText{pnum}, this feature also affects subscripts
and superscripts.

\subsection[8. pnum {}-- Proportional Figures]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{pnum} --
Proportional Figures}
Proportionally spaced figures: {\addfontfeature{Numbers=Proportional}0123456789} (default or with \textSourceText{lnum}),
{\addfontfeature{Numbers={Lowercase,Proportional}}0123456789} (with
\textSourceText{onum}). When combined with \textSourceText{onum}, this feature also affects subscripts and
superscripts. Most applications (including MS Word) with any support of OpenType features will support this feature and
\textSourceText{lnum} in such a way that you don't have to enter them manually.

\subsection[9. lnum {}-- Lining Figures]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{lnum} -- Lining
Figures}
Figures in a uniform height, harmonizing with uppercase letters: 0123456789 (default or with
\textSourceText{tnum}), {\addfontfeature{Numbers=Proportional}0123456789} (with \textSourceText{pnum}).

\subsection[10. zero {}-- Slashed Zero]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{zero} -- Slashed Zero}
Produces slashed zero in all number styles:
{\addfontfeature{Numbers=SlashedZero}0 \otab{0} \lprop{0} \oprop{0}. Includes superscripts and subscripts:
\sups{0~\oprop{0}}~\subs{0~\oprop{0}}}.

\hypertarget{SectionC}{}\section{C. Superscripts and Subscripts}
\subsection[11. sups {}-- Superscripts]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}.
\textSourceText{sups} -- Superscripts}
Produces superscript numbers and letters. Only affects lining tabular and oldstyle proportional figures. All lowercase
letters of the basic Latin alphabet are covered, and most uppercase letters: \sups{0123 \oprop{4567} abcde ABDEG}. Wherever
superscripts are needed (e.g. for footnote numbers), use \textSourceText{sups} instead of the raised and scaled
characters generated by some programs. With sups: \sups{4567}. Scaled: \textsuperscript{4567}.

\subsection[12. subs {}-- Subscripts]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{subs} -- Subscripts}
Produces subscript numbers. Only affects lining tabular (the default numbers) and oldstyle proportional figures (use
\textSourceText{pnum} and \textSourceText{onum}): \subs{8901 \oprop{2345}}.

\hypertarget{SectionD}{}\section{D. Ornaments}
\subsection[13. ornm {}-- Ornaments]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}.
\textSourceText{ornm} -- Ornaments}
Produces ornaments (fleurons) in either of two ways: as an indexed variant of the bullet character (U+2022) or as
variants of a-z, A-C (all fleurons are available by either method):

As a variant of {\textbullet}: 1=\ornm{\textbullet}, 2=\ornm[1]{\textbullet}, 3=\ornm[2]{\textbullet}, 4=\ornm[3]{\textbullet}, etc., up to 29.

As a variant of a-z, A-C: e=\ornm{e}, f=\ornm{f}, g=\ornm{g}, h=\ornm{h}, etc.

\noindent The method with letters of the alphabet is easier, but the method with bullets will produce a more satisfactory result
when text is displayed in an environment where Junicode is not available or \textSourceText{ornm} is not
implemented.

\hypertarget{SectionE}{}\section{E. Alphabetic Variants}
\subsection[14. cv01{}--cv52 {}-- Basic Latin Variants]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}.
\textSourceText{cv01-cv52} -- Basic Latin Variants}
These features also affect small cap (\textSourceText{smcp}) and underdotted (\textSourceText{ss07}) forms,
where available. Where Junicode has no variant for a Basic Latin letter, the expected \textSourceText{cvNN}
feature is skipped, being reserved for future development.

\subsection[16. ss01 {}-- Alternate thorn and eth]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{ss01} --
Alternate thorn and eth}
Produces Nordic thorn and eth (\revthorn{{\th}{\dh}{\TH}}) when the language is English, and English thorn and eth
({\th}{\dh}{\TH}) with any other language, reversing the font’s usual usage. This also affects small caps, crossed
thorn (ꝥ \revthorn{ꝥ}---see also
\hyperlink{OtherLatin}{\textSourceText{cv67}}), combining mark eth
(U+1DD9, ◌ᷙ \revthorn{◌ᷙ}), and enlarged thorn and eth (see \textSourceText{\hyperlink{ss06}{ss06}}).
This feature depends on \textSourceText{\hyperlink{req}{loca}} (Localized Forms), which in most applications will
always be enabled.

\subsection[17. ss02 {}-- Insular Letter{}-Forms]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{ss02} --
Insular Letter-Forms}
Produces insular letter-forms, e.g. {\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=2}dfgrsw}. Does not affect capitals (except W), as these do not not commonly have
insular shapes in early manuscripts. For these, enter the Unicode code points or use the Character Variant
(\textSourceText{cvNN}) features.

\subsection[18. ss04 {}-- High Overline]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{ss04} -- High
Overline}
Produces a high overline over letters used as roman numbers: {\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=4}cdijlmvx CDIJLMVXↃ}.

\subsection[19. ss05 {}-- Medium{}-High Overline]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{ss05} --
Medium-High Overline}
Produces a medium-high overline over (or through the ascenders of) letters used as roman numbers, and some others as
well: {\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=5,Style=Historic}bcdhijklmſvx{\th}}.

\hypertarget{ss06}{}\subsection[20. ss06 {}-- Enlarged Minuscules]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{ss06} --
Enlarged Minuscules}
Lowercase letters that match the height of normal ones, but with a higher x-height, e.g.
{\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=6}abcdefg}.
Covers the whole of the basic Latin alphabet and several other letters: consult the MUFI recommendation for details,
and if you are using the variable version of the font (JunicodeVF), consider using the
\href{https://psb1558.github.io/Junicode-New/EnlargedAxis.html}{Enlarged axis} instead, for reasons of flexibility and
accessibility.

\subsection[21. ss07 {}-- Underdotted Text]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{ss07} --
Underdotted Text}
Produces underdotted text (indicating deletion in medieval manuscripts) for many
letters (including
the whole of the basic Latin alphabet and a number of other letters), e.g.
{\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=7}abcdefg HIJKLM}. This also affects small
caps, e.g. \textsc{abcdef} $\rightarrow $ {\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=7}\textsc{abcdef}}.
For letters without corresponding underdotted forms (e.g. U+A751, ꝑ),
use U+0323, combining dot below (\hspace{0.2em}ꝑ̣).

\subsection[22. ss08 {}-- Contextual Long s]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{ss08} --
Contextual Long s}
In English and French text only, varies \textLetterExample{s} and \textLetterExample{ſ} according to rules
followed by many early printers: {\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=8}sports, essence, stormy, disheveled, transfusions, slyness, cliffside}. For this
feature to work properly, \textSourceText{calt} ``Contextual Alternates'' must also be enabled (as it should be by
default: see \hyperlink{req}{Required Features} below).

\hypertarget{ss16}{}\subsection[23. ss16 {}-- Contextual r Rotunda]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{ss16} --
Contextual r Rotunda}
Converts \textLetterExample{r} to \textLetterExample{ꝛ} (lowercase only) following the
most common rules of medieval manuscripts: {\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=16}priest, firmer, frost, ornament}. For this feature to work properly,
\textSourceText{calt} ``Contextual Alternates'' must also be enabled (as it should be by default: see
\hyperlink{req}{Required Features} below).

\textSourceText{cv}\textSourceText{99} -- revert small cap \textsc{a} to lowercase a}
1=a. This features reverts small cap
\textLetterExample{\textsc{a}} to \textLetterExample{a}, enabling it to
ligature with small cap \textLetterExample{\textsc{n}} or
\textLetterExample{\textsc{r}} via \textSourceText{hlig}: \textsc{\cvd{99}{\hlig{an, ar}}}.
Be sure to apply \textSourceText{smcp}, \textSourceText{cv99} and
\textSourceText{hlig} to both components of the ligature.

\hypertarget{SectionF}{}\section{F. Punctuation}
MUFI encodes nearly twenty marks of punctuation in the PUA. In Junicode these can be accessed in
either of two ways: all are indexed variants of \textLetterExample{.} (period), and all are associated with the Unicode marks of
punctuation they most resemble (but it should not be inferred that the medieval marks are semantically identical with
the Unicode marks, or that there is an etymological relationship between them). The first method will be easier for
most to use, but the second is more likely to yield acceptable fallbacks in environments where Junicode is not
available.

Marks with Unicode encoding are not included here, as they can safely be entered directly. In MUFI 4.0 several marks
have PUA encodings, but have since that release been assigned Unicode code points: \textit{paragraphus} (⹍
U+2E4D), medieval comma (⹌~U+2E4C), \textit{punctus elevatus} (⹎ U+2E4E), \textit{virgula suspensiva}
(⹊ U+2E4A), triple dagger (⹋ U+2E4B).

\subsection[26. ss18 {}-- Old{}-Style Punctuation Spacing]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}.

\subsection[36. cv78 {}-- Variant of * (asterisk)]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{cv78} --
Variant of * (asterisk)}
1=\cvd{78}{*}. MUFI defines U+F1EC as a \textit{signe de renvoi}. Manuscripts employ a number of shapes (of which this is one) for
this purpose. Junicode defines it as a variant of the asterisk---the most common modern \textit{signe de renvoi}.

\subsection[37. cv79 {}-- Variants of / (slash)]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}.
\textSourceText{cv7}\textSourceText{9} -- Variants of / (slash)}
1=\cvd{79}{/}, 2=\cvd[1]{79}{/}. The first of these is Unicode, U+2E4E.

\hypertarget{SectionG}{}\section{G. Abbreviations}
\subsection[38. cv80 {}-- Variant of ꝝ (U+A75D, rum

1=\cvd{80}{ꝝ}.

\subsection[39. cv81 {}-- Variants of ◌͛ (U+035B, combining zigzag
above)]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{cv81} -- Variants of ◌͛ (U+035B, combining
zigzag above)}
1=\cvd{81}{◌͛}, 2=\cvd[1]{81}{◌͛}, 3=\cvd[2]{81}{◌͛}. Positioning of the zigzag can differ from that of other combining
marks, e.g. b͛, f͛, d͛. If \textSourceText{calt} ``Contextual Alternates'' is enabled (as it is by
default in most apps), variant forms of \textSourceText{cv81[2]} will be used with several letters, e.g. \cvd[1]{81}{d͛,
  f͛, k͛}. Enable \textSourceText{case} for forms that harmonize with capitals
({\addfontfeature{Letters=Uppercase}\cvd[1]{81}{A͛ B͛ C͛ D͛}}), \textSourceText{smcp} for forms that harmonize with small caps
  (\textsc{\cvd[1]{81}{e͛ f͛ g͛ h͛}}).

\subsection[40. cv82 {}-- Variants of spacing ꝰ (U+A770)]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}.
\textSourceText{cv82} -- Variants of spacing ꝰ (U+A770)}
1=\cvd{82}{ꝰ}, 2=\cvd[1]{82}{ꝰ}. \textSourceText{cv82[1]} produces the baseline \textit{{}-us} abbreviation (same as MUFI
U+F1A6). MUFI also has an uppercase baseline \textit{{}-us} abbreviation (U+F1A5), but as there is no uppercase version
of U+A770 to pair it with, it is indexed separately here.

\subsection[41. cv83 {}-- Variants of ꝫ (U+A76B, {}``et{}'' abbreviation)]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}.
\textSourceText{cv83} -- Variants of ꝫ (U+A76B, ``et'' abbreviation)}
1=\cvd{83}{ꝫ}, 2=\cvd[1]{83}{ꝫ}. \textSourceText{[1]} is identical in shape to a
semicolon, but as it is semantically the same as U+A76B, it is preferable to use that
character with this feature. \textSourceText{[2]} produces a subscript version of
the character, a common variant in printed books.

\hypertarget{SectionH}{}\section{H. Combining Marks}
\hypertarget{cv84}{}\subsection[42. cv84 {}-- MUFI combining marks (variants of ◌᷑
U+1DD1)]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. \textSourceText{cv84} -- MUFI combining marks (variants of U+1DD1)}
MUFI encodes a number of combining marks in the PUA (with code points between E000 and F8FF), but when these characters
are entered directly, they can interfere with searching and accessibility, and some important applications fail to
position them correctly over their base characters. To avoid these problems, enter U+1DD1 (◌᷑, \textUName{combining ur
above}) and apply \textSourceText{cv84}, with the appropriate index, to both mark and base character. This
collection of marks does not include any Unicode-encoded marks (from the ``Combining Diacritical Marks'' ranges), as
these can safely be entered directly. It does include three marks (\textSourceText{cv84[35]},
\textSourceText{[36]} and \textSourceText{[37]}) that lack MUFI code points but are used to form MUFI
characters.

These marks can sometimes be produced by other \textSourceText{cvNN} features, which may be preferable to
\textSourceText{cv84} as providing fallbacks for applications that do not support Character Variant
(\textSourceText{cvNN}) features.

For some marks with PUA code points, users may find it easier to use \hyperlink{ss10}{entities} than this feature.

These marks are not affected by most other features. This is to preserve flexibility, given the rule that the feature
that produces them must be applied to both the mark and the base character. For example, if \textSourceText{smcp}
``Small Caps'' changed \textSourceText{cv84[11]} \cvd[10]{84}{◌᷑} to \textSourceText{[12]} \cvd[11]{84}{◌᷑}, it
would be impossible to produce the sequence \cvd[10]{84}{\textsc{na᷑a}} with the diacritic properly positioned.

\hypertarget{ss10}{}\subsection[43. ss10 {}-- Entity References for Combining Marks]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}.
\textSourceText{ss10} -- Entity References for Combining Marks}
Instead of \textSourceText{\hyperlink{cv84}{cv84}} for representing non-Unicode combining marks, some users may
wish to use XML/HTML-style entities. When \textSourceText{ss10} is turned on (preferably for the entire
text), these entities appear as combining marks and are correctly positioned over base characters.
For example, the letter \textLetterExample{e} followed by
\textLetterExample{\&{\textcompwordmark}\_eogo;} will yield \textLetterExample{e\&\_eogo;}. An advantage of entities is that
they are (unlike the PUA code points or the indexes of \textSourceText{cv84}) mnemonic and thus easy to use.
A disadvantage is that
searches cannot ignore combining marks entered by this method as they can using the \textSourceText{cv84} method.
(Every method of entering non-Unicode combining marks has disadvantages: users should weigh these, choose a method,
and stick with it.)

If you use any of these entities in a work intended for print publication, you should call your publisher’s
attention to them, since they will likely have their own method of representing them.

\subsection[44. ss20 {}-- Low Diacritics]{\stepcounter{Feature}{\theFeature}. ss20 -- Low Diacritics}
The MUFI recommendation includes a number of precomposed characters with base letters b, h, k, {\th}, ꝺ and {\dh}
and combining marks ◌ͣ (U+0363), ◌ͤ (U+0364), \cvd[16]{84}{◌᷑}
(U+1DD1\slash\textSourceText{cv84[17]}), ◌ͦ (U+0366), ◌ͬ (U+036C), ◌ᷢ (U+1DE2),
◌ͭ (U+036D), ◌ͮ (U+036E), ◌ᷦ (U+1DE6) and \cvd[20]{84}{◌᷑}
(U+1DD1/\textSourceText{cv84[21]}). Instead of being positioned above ascender height as usual (e.g.
\textLetterExample{hͣ}), the MUFI glyphs have the marks positioned above the x-height
(e.g. \textLetterExample{\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=20}hͣ}).
Using the MUFI code points for these precomposed glyphs can interfere with searching
and drastically reduce accessibility. Users of Junicode should instead use a sequence of base character + combining
mark, and apply \textSourceText{ss20} to the two glyphs. A variant shape of eth (\textLetterExample{{\dh}})
that accommodates the combining mark will be substituted for the normal base character (but this is not necessary for
the other base characters). Examples:
{\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=20}bͦ, ꝺᷦ, \cvd[16]{84}{h᷑}, kͤ, {\th}ͭ, {\dh}ᷢ}.

\textSourceText{ss20} affects only the diacritics and base characters listed here; other combinations (e.g.
\textLetterExample{mͤ}, \textLetterExample{\'{h}}) are not affected. It will therefore probably be safe
to apply this feature to the whole text if it is needed anywhere.

Produces ligatures for combinations that should not ordinarily be rendered as
ligatures in modern text.\footnote{Some
fonts define \textSourceText{hlig} differently, as including all ligatures in which at least one
element is an archaic character, e.g.
those involving long s (\textrm{ſ\hspace{0.2em}}). In Junicode, however, a
historic ligature is defined not by the characters it is composed of, but
rather by the join between them. If two characters (though modern) should not be joined except
in certain historic contexts, they form a historic ligature. If they should be
joined in all contexts (even if archaic), the ligature is not historic
and should be defined in \textSourceText{liga}.} Most of these are from the MUFI recommendation,
ranges B.1.1(b) and B.1.4. This feature does
not produce digraphs (which have a phonetic value), for which see

By ``digraph'' we mean conjoined letters that represent a phonetic value: the most common examples
for western languages are \textLetterExample{{\ae}} and \textLetterExample{{\oe}} (though these, because they
are so common, are not included in this feature). Use of this feature in web pages enables easier searches: for
example, producing \textLetterExample{\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=17}{\th}au} from
\textLetterExample{{\th}au} allows the word to be
searched as ``{\th}au.'' The digraphs covered by this feature are \textcolor[rgb]{0.5529412,0.15686275,0.11764706}{%
\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=17}aa, ao, au, av, ay, oo, vy,} plus capital and small cap equivalents and digraph + diacritic combinations anticipated in the
MUFI recommendation. To produce such a digraph + diacritic combination, either type a letter + diacritic combination as
the second element of the digraph or type the diacritic after the second element. For example,
\textLetterExample{a} + \textLetterExample{\'u} yields \textLetterExample{\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=17}a\'u}, and so does
\textLetterExample{a} + \textLetterExample{u} + U+0301 (combining acute accent). To produce a digraph +
diacritic combination not covered by MUFI (e.g. \textLetterExample{ꜵ̀}), you may have to enter the digraph
directly and not via \textSourceText{ss17} (rare diacritics, however, are usually safe to use with this
feature---e.g. \textLetterExample{\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=17}aaᷘ}). Note that \textSourceText{ss17} must be applied to the two
elements of the digraph and any following diacritic.

\hypertarget{req}{}\section{M. Required Features}
Required features, which provide some of the font’s most basic functionality---ligatures, support for
other features, kerning, and more---include \textSourceText{ccmp} (Glyph Composition/Decomposition),
\textSourceText{calt} (Contextual Alternates), \textSourceText{liga} (Standard Ligatures),
\textSourceText{loca} (Localized Forms), \textSourceText{rlig} (Required Ligatures),
\textSourceText{kern} (Horizontal Kerning), and \textSourceText{mark}/\textSourceText{mkmk} (Mark
Positioning). In MS Word these features have to be explicitly enabled on the Advanced tab of the Font dialog (Ctrl-D or
Cmd-D: enable Kerning, Standard Ligatures, and Contextual Alternates, and the others will be enabled automatically),
but in most other applications they are enabled by default.


\hypertarget{nonmufi}{}\section{N. Non-MUFI Code Points}
Characters in Junicode that do not have Unicode code points should be accessed via OpenType
features whenever possible. MUFI/PUA code points should be used only in applications that do not support OpenType, or
that support it only partially (for example, MS Word). For certain characters that lack either Unicode or MUFI code
points, code points in the Supplementary Private Use Area-A (plane 15) are available.
