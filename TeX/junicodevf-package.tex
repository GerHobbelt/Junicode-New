\section{Introduction}

This package supports Junicode VF, the variable \textbf{version} of Junicode
(2.204 or higher) for \lltech. Junicode VF is not yet in CTAN, so you must
install the font in your system in order to use it. This package loads
fontspec, so it is not necessary to load that package separately, even if you are using
other fonts alongside Junicode VF.

\section{Loading JunicodeVF}

Load the package in the usual way, with {\small\verb|\usepackage{JunicodeVF}|}.
By default, the main font is not a set of fixed outlines that can change only
by being scaled, but rather a set of
\emph{variable} outlines where glyphs sized for footnotes (typically about 8 points) are a
little heavier and wider than glyphs sized for block quotations (10 points),
those are heavier and wider than glyphs for the main
text (11 or 12 points), and those are heavier and wider
than glyphs for headers (18 points and higher):\\[0.5ex]

\noindent {\footnotesize This text is for footnotes,}\\
{\small this is for block quotations,}\\
this is for main text,\\[0.2ex]
{\Large and this is for headers.}\\[0.5ex]

\noindent It's not easy to see the difference between sizes in a brief example
like this one, but the effect is to promote legibility at small
sizes and prevent text blocks from looking
either darker or lighter than the main text on a page.\footnote{%
For example, on a typical LaTeX page a footnote like this, looked at as a block
of gray, is usually a little lighter than the main text. But on this page, the
“color” of the footnote matches that of the main text. The variation in glyph
shape responsible for this effect approximates the way letters in metal type were
typically wider and heavier at small sizes.} If the package's default settings
don't work for you, you can substitute your own, as explained below.

The {\small\verb|\usepackage|} command for this package can take many options,
which will be discussed in the appropriate sections below. However, the
package will work perfectly well with no options at all.

\section{Customizing Numbers}

Junicode's default numbers are \textbf{oldstyle proportional} (1234). You can change this
default for the entire document with either or both of the options \textbf{lining} and
\textbf{tabular}:

\begin{center}
    {\small\verb|\usepackage[lining,tabular]{JunicodeVF}|}
\end{center}

\noindent You can pass other options affecting the numbers of the four standard
styles (Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic) of the main text font via the
\textbf{MainFeatures} option:

\begin{center}
    {\small\verb|\usepackage[MainFeatures={StylisticSet=9}]{JunicodeVF}|}
\end{center}

\noindent Like most of this package's options, \textbf{MainFeatures} is a way of passing
features to fontspec's various font-setting commands. In this case, Stylistic
Set 9 is Junicode's "Alternate Figures" feature, which substitutes more
modern shapes for certain oldstyle numbers (it is used in this document).

\section{Customizing the Main Font}

The main font is organized into the four traditional styles (Regular, Italic,
Bold, Bold Italic), which can be invoked in the usual ways
({\small\verb|\textit{}|}, etc.). As explained above, however, each of these
styles varies with the font size, so that the actual number of styles is
potentially very large.

This package's default styles stay fairly close to what you would get with
Junicode's static fonts. But you can customize these styles in a number of ways.
For example, the style used for the body text of the \textit{Junicode Manual}
is wider than the default, giving the text a lighter and more open look. You
can get that look (or any other) by passing a \textbf{SizeFeatures} option for 
each of the four styles:

\usepackage[
    MainFeatures={StylisticSet=9},
    MainRegularSizeFeatures={
        SizeFeatures={
            {Size={-8.6},        RawFeature={axis={wght=550,wdth=120}}},
            {Size={8.6-10.99},   RawFeature={axis={wght=475,wdth=115}}},
            {Size={10.99-21.59}, RawFeature={axis={wght=400,wdth=112.5}}},
            {Size={21.59-},      RawFeature={axis={wght=351,wdth=100}}}
        }
    },
    MainItalicSizeFeatures={
        SizeFeatures={
            {Size={-8.6},        RawFeature={axis={wght=550,wdth=118}}},

            {Size={10.99-21.59}, RawFeature={axis={wght=450,wdth=111}}},
            {Size={21.59-},      RawFeature={axis={wght=372,wdth=98}}}
        }
    },
    MainBoldSizeFeatures={
        SizeFeatures={
            {Size={-8.6},        RawFeature={axis={wght=700,wdth=120}}},
            {Size={8.6-10.99},   RawFeature={axis={wght=700,wdth=115}}},
            {Size={10.99-21.59}, RawFeature={axis={wght=650,wdth=112.5}}},
            {Size={21.59-},      RawFeature={axis={wght=600,wdth=100}}}
        }
    },
    MainBoldItalicSizeFeatures={
        SizeFeatures={
            {Size={-8.6},        RawFeature={axis={wght=700,wdth=118}}},
            {Size={8.6-10.99},   RawFeature={axis={wght=700,wdth=114}}},
            {Size={10.99-21.59}, RawFeature={axis={wght=650,wdth=111}}},
            {Size={21.59-},      RawFeature={axis={wght=600,wdth=98}}}
        }
    }
]{JunicodeVF}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\noindent This is less intimidating than it looks. With
\textbf{MainRegularSizeFeatures} and the other options for font styles, we pass \textbf{SizeFeatures}
to fontspec’s {\small\verb|\setmainfont|} command---precisely the same options
we would use if we were addressing fontspec directly.
For each size-range, \textbf{RawFeature} defines values for the font’s \textbf{wght} (Weight)
and \textbf{wdth} (Width) axes.\footnote{There is also a third axis, Enlarged (ENLA),
but this is highly specialized and won't be useful in most documents. It is
discussed separately below.} Possible values for \textbf{wght} are
300–700 (400 is the default), and possible values for \textbf{wdth} are 75–125
(100 is the default).

If you like, you can simplify these options by defining a new command:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\SizeRecord}[3]{
    {Size={#1},RawFeature={axis={wght=#2,wdth=#3}}}
}
\usepackage[
    MainFeatures={StylisticSet=10},
    MainRegularSizeFeatures={
        SizeFeatures={
            \SizeRecord{-8.59}{550}{120},
            \SizeRecord{8.59-10.99}{475}{115},
            \SizeRecord{10.99-21.59}{400}{112.5},
            \SizeRecord{21.59-}{475}{115}
        }
    },
    . . .
]{JunicodeVF}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\noindent In addition to options like \textbf{MainRegularSizeFeatures},
you can pass options for features other than \textbf{SizeFeatures}.
These are \textbf{MainRegularFeatures}, \textbf{MainItalicFeatures},
and so on---named like the other options, but without \textbf{Size}.
For example, if you want Discretionary Ligatures to be on only for the
Regular style, simply add a \textbf{MainRegularFeatures} option:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\SizeRecord}[3]{
    {Size={#1},RawFeature={axis={wght=#2,wdth=#3}}}
}
\usepackage[
    MainFeatures={StylisticSet=10},
    MainRegularFeatures={Ligatures=Discretionary},
    MainRegularSizeFeatures={
        SizeFeatures={
            \SizeRecord{-8.59}{550}{120},
            \SizeRecord{8.59-10.99}{475}{115},
            \SizeRecord{10.99-21.59}{400}{112.5},
            \SizeRecord{21.59-}{475}{115}
        }
    },
    . . .
]{JunicodeVF}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\section{Selecting Alternate Styles}

In addition to the document's main font, you can choose from fifty
predefined styles. These match the thirty-eight styles supplied by the
static version of Junicode, plus twelve more. The commands for shifting to these
styles are as follows (of the italic styles, only the base “jItalic” is listed;
append “Italic” to any of the others, except “Regular”):

\begin{multicols}{3}
    \jCond\textbackslash jRegular

    \textbackslash jItalic
    
    \textbackslash jCond
    
    \textbackslash jSmCond
    
    \textbackslash jSmExp
    
    \textbackslash jExp
    
    \textbackslash jLight
    
    \textbackslash jLightCond
    
    \textbackslash jLightSmCond
    
    \textbackslash jLightSmExp
    
    \textbackslash jLightExp
    
    \textbackslash jMedium
    
    \textbackslash jMediumCond
    
    \textbackslash jMediumSmCond
    
    \textbackslash jMediumSmExp
    
    \textbackslash jMediumExp
    
    \textbackslash jSmbold
    
    \textbackslash jSmboldCond
    
    \textbackslash jSmboldSmCond
    
    \textbackslash jSmboldSmExp
    
    \textbackslash jSmboldExp
    
    \textbackslash jBold
    
    \textbackslash jBoldCond
    
    \textbackslash jBoldSmCond
    
    \textbackslash jBoldSmExp
    
    \textbackslash jBoldExp
    
\end{multicols}

\noindent These commands will be self-explanatory if you bear in mind Junicode's 
abbreviations for style names: Cond=Condensed, Exp=Expanded, Sm=Semi. Use
them to shift temporarily to a style other than that of the main text.
For example, to shift briefly to the Light Condensed style for a short phrase, use
this code:
\begin{center}
{\small\verb|{\jLightCond a short phrase}|}.
\end{center}
The result: {\jLightCond a short phrase}.

To add features to any of these styles, use the style name
(without the prefixed \textbf{j} and with \textbf{Features} appended)
as a package option. To change the size features for the style,
do the same, but with \textbf{SizeFeatures} instead of \textbf{Features}
appended. For example:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
    \usepackage[
        LightCondFeatures={
            Language=English,
            StylisticSet=2
        },
        LightCondSizeFeatures={
            SizeFeatures={
                Size={5-},RawFeature={axis={wght=325,wdth=85}}
            }
        }
    ]{JunicodeVF}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\noindent This will shift text in the Light Condensed style from default to insular
letter-shapes and slightly increase the weight and width of all glyphs in that style.
Here the \textbf{SizeFeatures} section is very simple (as in the package file itself),
but you can have as many size ranges as you want, just as you can for the main font.

\section{The Enlarge Axis}

Junicode's Enlarge axis is for a special purpose: to represent the enlarged
minuscule letters that often begin sentences and other textual units in medieval manuscripts.
Thus it should normally be applied only to single letters, not to runs of text.

This package defines three different styles for the Enlarge axis, in three sizes:\\[0.5ex]

\noindent\textbackslash EnlargedOne {\EnlargedOne b}\\
\textbackslash EnlargedTwo {\EnlargedTwo b}\\
\textbackslash EnlargedThree {\EnlargedThree b}\\[0.5ex]

\noindent You can produce an italic version of the enlarged minuscule by appending “Italic” to
the style name. You can also customize these styles just as you can the other alternate
styles. The only difference is that you need to supply a value for the Enlarge axis (ENLA)
as well as the others. Again, a command for this purpose may help:

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{\ENLASizeRecord}[4]{
    {Size={#1},RawFeature={axis={wght=#2,wdth=#3,ENLA=#4}}}
}
\usepackage[ENLAOneFeatures={
    SizeFeatures={
        \ENLASizeRecord{5-}{600}{100}{65}
    }
}]{JunicodeVF}
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

\section{Other Commands}

This package's other commands are offered as conveniences---shorter and more
mnemonic than the fontspec commands they invoke (though of course all fonspec commands
remain available). Each of these commands
also has a corresponding “text” command that works like 
{\small\verb|\textit{}|}—that is, it takes
as its sole argument the text to which the command will be applied. Each “text” command
consists of the main command with “text” prefixed—for example,
{\small\verb|\textInsularLetterForms{}|}
corresponding to {\small\verb|\InsularLetterForms|}.  For a fuller account of the OpenType features
applied by these commands, see Chapter 4 of the \textit{Junicode Manual}, “Feature Reference.”

is {\small\verb|\jcv[num]{num}|}, where the second (required) argument is the number of the Character Variant feature,
and the first (optional) argument is an index into the variants provided by that feature (starting with zero, the default).
\textbackslash textcv takes an additional required argument ({\small\verb|\textcv[num]{num}{text}|}—the text to which the
feature should be applied.

Character Variant features can also be selected with mnemonics, listed below. For example, a feature for
lowercase \textbf{a} can be expressed as {\small\verb|\textcv[2]{\jcva}{a}|}, yielding \textbf{\textcv[2]{\jcva}{a}}.
