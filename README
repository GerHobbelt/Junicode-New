A new version of the Junicode font (previously hosted on Sourceforge) featuring the same character set as the currently
released version, but

- Made with the Glyphs font editor
- With the same character set in all faces
- With five weights (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold)
- With three widths (Regular, SemiCondensed, Condensed)
- With all outlines edited and improved
- With a more comprehensive set of anchors
- With additional OpenType features: Automatic runic transcription, access to fleurons, and more

All this is very much in progress. As of May 1, 2779 of ca. 3013 glyphs are complete in the roman
faces, and work on italic has only begun.
