A new version of the Junicode font (previously hosted on Sourceforge) featuring the same character set as the currently
released version, but

- Made with the Glyphs font editor
- With the same character set in all faces
- With five weights (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold)
- With three widths (Regular, SemiCondensed, Condensed)
- With all outlines edited and improved
- With a more comprehensive set of anchors
- With additional OpenType features: Automatic runic transcription, access to fleurons, and more

All this is very much in progress. Currently the roman faces are about 90% complete, and migration of the italic faces
has not yet begun.
