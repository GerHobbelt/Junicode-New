<h1>Searchable web pages with MUFI and JuniusX</h1>
<p>
JuniusX fully implements the recommendations of the Medieval Unicode
Font Initiative (MUFI), which offers an encoding scheme for medieval
texts based on Unicode, the worldwide standard for text
exchange. You probably know that a computer text is a string of
numbers, each representing a character: using Unicode, you employ a
standard mapping of numbers to characters, ensuring that a text typed
by your friend in Thailand and sent to you as an email attachment will
look the same when it gets to you as it did when it left your friend’s
computer. MUFI does a similar job for medieval characters. For
example, if you need a Dutch libra sign, you won’t find it in Unicode;
but MUFI has it at code point U+F1EA (), and it will be recognizable
to anyone with a MUFI-compliant font (like JuniusX).
</p>
<p>
To work its magic, MUFI selects characters of interest to medievalists
from the Unicode standard, and when a medieval character is missing
from Unicode it assigns a code point from a block of numbers set aside
for individuals and groups to use in any way they like: the
<b>Private Use Area</b>. MUFI-compliant fonts like JuniusX must all
agree on the mappings of code point to character defined by MUFI so
that texts can be exchanged reliably.
</p>
<p>
For example, here is the beginning of a diplomatic text of the Old
Norse <i>Vǫluspá</i>, copied and pasted from the
Medieval Nordic Text Archive (because JuniusX Italic is not yet
ready, the text is presented only in roman type):
</p>
<p class="mufitext" lang="is">
<span class="initcap">H</span>lıoðſ bið ec allar kinꝺir meiri oc miɴi maugo<br/>
heimꝺalar uilðo at ec ualꝼꜹþr uel ꝼyr telia ꝼoꝛn<br/>
ſpioll ꝼíra þꜹ er ꝼremſt um man. Ec mán iǫtna<br/>
ar um boꝛna þ⸠ꜹ̣⸡a er ꝼoꝛꝺom mic ꝼǫꝺꝺa hoꝼꝺo. nio man ec heima<br/>
nío iviþi[vr] miot uið mran ꝼyr molꝺ neðan.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Looks great, right? And it will read the same way whether it’s set in
JuniusX, Andron Scriptor, Cardo, or Palemonas MUFI. There’s just one
problem—but it’s a significant one. To illustrate, look at the last
word in the second line:
  <b>ꝼoꝛn</b>. That’s an <b>insular f</b> in the first position and an
  <b>r rotunda</b> in the third; but try searching
this text for the word “forn” using your browser’s search function
(Ctrl-F or Cmd-F). What happened? Your search skipped right over
<b>ꝼoꝛn</b> in the medieval text and landed on “forn” in this
  paragraph. The fact that <b>f</b> and <b>r</b> are encoded differently
  in this text from the way they’re encoded in plain text means that
this text can’t be searched the way most webpages can. (To be a little
  more precise, some browsers will find the <b>f</b>, but none of them
  will find the <b>r</b>).
</p>
<p>
This is not to criticise MENOTA, which has its own powerful
search tools; but not every website is so ambitious and
sophisticated—and sometimes a reader wants to do a quick and dirty search.
  Given that one of the principal advantages of an etext is
searchability, is it possible to create a MUFI-compliant webpage, rich
with medieval characters, that
can easily be searched?
</p>
<p>
Turns out that it is both possible and easy to create such a page
using JuniusX. We’ll take it in two steps. The first will be to create
as plain an etext as we can get away with, and the second will be to
style this text using CSS (“Cascading Style Sheets,” the standard for
styling web pages) and the features
of JuniusX.
</p>
<p>
For the text, we want to convert as many of those exotic characters as
possible into their plain-text equivalents. Here’s my attempt:
</p>
<p class="mufitext" lang="is">
<span class="initcap">H</span>lioðs bið ec allar
    kindir meiri oc mini maugo<br/>
  heimdalar uilðo at ec ualfavþr uel
    fyr telia forn<br/>
  spioll fíra þav er fremst um man. Ec mán iǫtna<br/>
  ar um borna þ⸠aṿ⸡a er fordom mic fǫdda hofdo. nio man ec heima<br/>
  nío iviþi[vr] miot uið mę́ran fyr mold neðan.
</p>
<p>
If “plain text” is what you can type on a U.S. keyboard, we haven’t
quite made it: we still have
several accented characters and the Icelandic thorn and eth, not to
mention the strange brackets in line 4 (U+2E20 and U+2E21). There’s
nothing we can do about the brackets, but the Icelandic
characters are familiar enough to medievalists that we needn’t worry
about them. The dot under the <b>v</b> in what was an
<b class="avlig">av</b> digraph (which we took
apart to make it searchable as <b>av</b>, but we’ll
put it back together later) is a <b>combining
diacritical mark</b>: you type it right after the base character, and
your software takes care of positioning it correctly. The accented
<b>ę́</b> was a character in the Private Use Area, but I
have changed it to <b>ę</b> (U+0119, common in modern Polish) plus
another combining mark, U+0301, the acute accent. That makes it
standard Unicode, like the other accented characters. The <b>ę</b>
is searchable as <b>e</b>, and browsers will
ignore the marks when searching.
</p>
<p>
The next step is to select what we need from among the OpenType
features of JuniusX. OpenType is a standard for font construction that
allows fonts to do all kinds of clever things. To cite one common
example, when you type the letters “f‌ind” and the <b>f</b> and the <b>i</b> come out
joined in a ligature (“find”), an OpenType feature did that. But
JuniusX has a lot of OpenType features (eighty of them, to be
precise) that do a lot of things.
</p>
<p>
Here are the ones we’ll want to apply to the whole text:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>All instances of <b>s</b> in this text are long <span class="longs">(s)</span>: the “Long
  s” feature (hist or ss03) does that.</li>
  <li>All instances of <b>d</b> are also round: we accomplish that with
  Character Variant 5 (cv05).</li>
  <li>All instances of <b>f</b> are insular (ꝼ): for that we need Character
  Variant 9 (cv09).</li>
  <li>Instances of <b>r</b> are round after rounded characters like <b>o</b> and <b>ꝺ</b>;
  we get that effect with the “Contextual r rotunda” feature (ss16).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The features whose four-letter tags begin with <b>ss</b> are Stylistic
Sets, and they are either on or off. The Character Variant features
contain a list of variants of a particular character; we select from
this list with a numerical index (starting with 1).
To turn on these OpenType features, then, we need the following CSS rule:
</p>
<pre><code>font-feature-settings: "ss03" on, "cv05" 1, "cv09" 1, "ss16" on;</code></pre>
<p>
When we apply that to our fragment of <i>Vǫluspá</i>, here’s what we get:
</p>
<p class="medtext" lang="is">
<span class="initcap">H</span>lioðs bið ec allar
    kindir meiri oc mini maugo<br/>
  heimdalar uilðo at ec ualfavþr uel
    fyr telia forn<br/>
  spioll fíra þav er fremst um man. Ec mán iǫtna<br/>
  ar um borna þ⸠aṿ⸡a er fordom mic fǫdda hofdo. nio man ec heima<br/>
  nío iviþi[vr] miot uið mę́ran fyr mold neðan.
</p>
<p>
One line of CSS, and already we’re almost home! But there are several
special cases to attend to. There’s the dotless <b>i</b> in <b>Hlioðs</b>, the small
capital <b><span class="pcap">n</span></b> in <b>mi<span
  class="pcap">n</span>i</b>, the <b class="avlig">av</b> digraph that has to be
  reassembled, and the <b>r rotunda</b> that should be a regular
<b>r</b> at the end of <b lang="is">ualfꜹþr</b>. For those, we devise CSS classes that turn
OpenType features on or off, and we apply these classes to individual
words or letters:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>For dotless <b>i</b>, the style “dotlessi” selects the second variant
  of <b>i</b> in Character Variant 13 (cv13 2).</li>
  <li>For <b><span class="pcap">n</span></b>,
  we need the “pcap” style, which turns on
  the “petite capitals”
  feature (pcap). (Petite capitals are different from regular small
  caps in that they’re sized to be mixed with lowercase
  letters.)</li>
  <li>For ꜹ, a ligature with a phonetic value (like æ), distinct from other
    ligatures, we use the “avlig” style, which turns on “Digraphs” (ss17).
  </li>
  <li>For the <b>r</b> that shouldn’t be rotunda, we use the “norrotunda”
  style, which temporarily turns off the “Contextual r rotunda” feature (ss16).</li>
</ul>
<p>
As an example of what the HTML will look like, here’s the first line
of our text:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;span class="initcap"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;l&lt;span class="dotlessi"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;oðs bið
    ec allar kindir meiri oc mi&lt;span class="pcap"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;i maugo</code></pre>
<p>
Of course it looks horrible, but only you will ever see the ugly
HTML code or the CSS. Your readers will see this:
</p>
<p class="medtext" lang="is">
<span class="initcap">H</span>l<span class="dotlessi">i</span>oðs bið ec allar
    kindir meiri oc mi<span class="pcap">n</span>i maugo<br/>
  heimdalar uilðo at ec ualf<span class="avlig">av</span>þ<span class="norrotunda">r</span> uel
    fyr telia forn<br/>
  spioll fíra þ<span class="avlig">av</span> er fremst um man. Ec mán iǫtna<br/>
  ar um borna þ⸠<span class="avlig">aṿ</span>⸡a er fordom mic fǫdda hofdo. nio man ec heima<br/>
  nío iviþi[vr] miot uið mę́ran fyr mold neðan.
</p>
<p>
and if any of them should happen to hit Ctrl-F and perform a
quick-and-dirty search for “kindir” or “forn”
or “mini” or “<span lang="is">ualfavþr</span>” or “meran,” they’ll find what they’re looking for.
</p>
<p>
  For one final refinement, we change the brackets in the text to CSS classes:
  “deletion” and “restoration.” The brackets themselves are not inserted in
  the text, but rather via the CSS content property. The effect of this change
  is that searches of the text will ignore the brackets: thus a user can search
  for (and find) iviþivr. This change may or may not be desirable, depending on
  whether you want the brackets themselves to be searchable. The final text:
</p>
<p class="medtext" lang="is">
<span class="initcap">H</span>l<span class="dotlessi">i</span>oðs bið ec allar
    kindir meiri oc mi<span class="pcap">n</span>i maugo<br/>
  heimdalar uilðo at ec ualf<span class="avlig">av</span>þ<span class="norrotunda">r</span> uel

  nío iviþi<span class="restoration">vr</span> miot uið mę́ran fyr mold neðan.
