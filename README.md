A new version of the Junicode font (previously hosted on Sourceforge) featuring full compliance with
the [Medieval Unicode Font Initiative](https://skaldic.abdn.ac.uk/m.php?p=mufi) specification (version 4.0) and including all medieval characters
added to Unicode since MUFI 4.0. The font:

- is made with the [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/) font editor;
- has the same character set in all faces;
- has five weights (Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold)
- and three widths (Regular, SemiCondensed, Condensed);
- has improved outlines,
- a more comprehensive set of anchors for mark positioning,
- and additional OpenType features—automatic runic transcription, access to fleurons, and more.

All this is very much in progress. As of 19 May 2020, 2971 of ca. 3038 glyphs are complete in the roman
faces, and work on italic has only begun.
