# Junicode â€“ The Font for Medievalists

The Junicode-One branch of this site contains the latest release of the Junicode
font formerly hosted on sourceforge.net, while the next major version, Junicode Two,
is being developed in the Master branch.

As Junicode Two is not yet complete, Junicode One is currently the stable version of the
font. The only changes being made in Junicode One are bug fixes: all new features will
be added to Junicode Two.
